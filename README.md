# RyiSnow-Java-Gama---AI-Interaction-Implementation
Some classes on how to implement the AI interaction using poe.com python wrapper

I only included the classes and folders related for the implementation though there were some features in my game mixed in but you are free to use them which are:
- Auto-adjusting title screen image resolution when full screen along with the texts in the UI
- Screen glitch effect, zoom in, and greyscale effect
- Implementation of Cursor

Main Features of AI implementation
- Auto updates the Poe wrapper to reduce the amount of updating the reposutory when the library is outdated and unusable.
- Auto installs all requirements to run the Poe wrapper to the latest version (tls_client, websocket, websocket-client)
- Can send messages to NPC and respond quickly (Can respond in 1-2 seconds if internet is good.)
- Use of poe.com pb-cookies like SillyTavern or Tavern AI using poe.com
- Auto deletes conversation from poe.com to secure privacy
