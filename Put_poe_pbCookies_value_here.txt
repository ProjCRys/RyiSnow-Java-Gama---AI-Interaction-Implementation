To get pb-cookiesValue:
Go to poe.com
Create an account (I suggest making a dummy account just in case)
Right click anywhere
Click Inspect
Go to Applications Tab (If you can't find it, try to locate: "Welcome", "Elements", "Console" and find '>>' and click on it to reveal new tabs)
Go to 'Cookies' > https://poe.com/ > And from the right you can probably see the 'p-b'
Get the text below the 'Value'
Delete all this and paste the pbCookies Value here.
